 * Type definition for the callback function prototype used by the FPGA Manager

 * for a user defined method of sequentially reading FPGA configuration
 * bitstream data from an arbitrary input source. Example input sources include
 * a file resident on a file system, a network stream socket, or a fixed
 * address block in flash memory. The only requirement on the input source is
 * that it is capable of supplying consecutive blocks of data of the requested
 * size from the FPGA configuration bitstream as demanded by the FPGA Manager.
 *
 * During FPGA configuration, the FPGA Manager periodically calls the user
 * defined callback function to fetch the next \e buf_len consecutive
 * configuration data bytes from the user defined input stream. The callback
 * function fills the FPGA Manager supplied buffer \e buf with up to the next
 * \e buf_len bytes of configuration bitsteam data as read from the input
 * source stream. The callback function returns the number of configuration
 * bytes read into \e buf or 0 upon reaching the end of the configuration
 * bitstream data.
 *
 * If an error occurs on the configuration bitstream input source, then the
 * callback function should return an error code value less than 0.

 *
 * \param       user_data
 *              A 32-bit data word for passing user defined data. The content
 *              of this parameter is user defined. The FPGA Manager merely
